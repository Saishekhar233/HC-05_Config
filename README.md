# HC-05 Bluetooth Module Configuration

This file demonstrates, how to configure the **Baudrate** of **HC-05** bluetooth module with an **Arduino** board.

#Wiring

Most HC-05 modules require a 5V operating voltage. However, the TX/RX pins work at **3.3V**.

Although most modules have on-board current limiting circuit which allows the TX/RX pins to work with 5V signal, a 5V to 3.3V circuit (a simple **voltage divider**) at the Arduino TX pin is recommended.

###Parts

- HC-05 Bluetooth module(Bluetooth over serial)
- Arduino board(Any)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- Arduino IDE

###Wiring Guide

- HC-05 GND — Arduino GND Pin
- HC-05 VCC (5V) — Arduino 5V
- HC-05 TX — Arduino Pin 10 (soft RX)
- HC-05 RX — Arduino Pin 9 (soft TX)

The figure below describes the interface between the Arduino and HC-05 module :

#Programming

The default setting of the HC-05 is suitable for most cases. However, if you want to change some of the setting such as increase the baud rate for higher speed data, you’ll need to enter HC-05’s command mode. Some HC-05 modules have a command pin built onto the board, the one we carry in our shop use a button to enter command mode instead.

To enter command mode, **power off the HC-05 module, hold the command mode button** (or pull pin 34 high if the HC-05 module doesn’t have a AT button), then power the HC-05 module back on. Once you are in command mode, the module’s LED led will blink at about 2 seconds interval.

Now that your HC-05 is in command mode (also known as AT mode), you can use the Arduino sketch below to program your Bluetooth module.

For sketch , please go to [HERE](../../Mega_CAN_BLE_Working/HC05_config.ino)

HC-05’s AT mode **baud rate is fixed at 38400**, however, the BT communication baud rate can be changed from the default 9600 to as fast as 115200 (or faster, but we never tested).

For HC-05's AT command document click [HERE](../../Mega_CAN_BLE_Working/HC-0305_serial_module_AT_commamd_.pdf)

###Example

Once you uploaded the sketch onto your Arduino, open the serial monitor at 9600 baud rate, select CR+NL, and you should be able to send AT commands to the HC-05.

Every time you transmit “AT” (without the quotes), the HC-05 should reply with “OK”

To check your HC-05’s version, enter “AT+VERSION”

To change the name of the module, enter “AT+NAME=MYBTNAME”

To check the current password, enter “AT+PSWD”

To change the password, enter “AT+PSWD=2345”

To check the current baud rate, enter “AT+UART”

**To change the BT baud rate to 115200, 1 stop bit, 0 parity, enter “AT+UART=115200,1,0”**
